When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working with other people, so that they can also contribute

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might want to do this because:
1) you might have many people working on the same file and this might take lot of time fo clear merges
2) because you might want to experiment and not always sync

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is when I clone some repository on GitHub
Clone is to make a local copy of a repository
Branches are different versions of the same repository
